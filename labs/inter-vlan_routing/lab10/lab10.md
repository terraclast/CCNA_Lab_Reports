## Steps:

### Set Up IP Addressing:
    
    - LAN 1: 192.168.1.0/24
    - PC1:   192.168.1.2
    - PC2:   192.168.1.3
    
    - LAN 2: 192.168.2.0/24
    - PC3:   192.168.2.2
    - PC4:   192.168.2.3

### Assign IPs to router interfaces connected to each LAN:
    - Router Interface to LAN 1: 192.168.1.1
    - Router Interface to LAN 2: 192.168.2.1

### Configure Basic VLANs (Optional):
    - Switch 1: VLAN 10
    - Switch 2: VLAN 20

### Assign Ports to VLANs:
    - Assign each PCâ€™s switch port to the respective VLAN on both switches.

### Router Configuration:
    - Configure static routes between the two LANs:
        - Add route for 192.168.1.0/24 to 192.168.2.0/24
        - Add route for 192.168.2.0/24 to 192.168.1.0/24

### Test Connectivity:
    - Ping from PC1 to PC3 and from PC2 to PC4 to test inter-VLAN routing.
    - Confirm that all PCs within the same LAN can communicate.

### Expected Outcome:
    - PCs on different LANs should successfully communicate via the router.
    - Basic understanding of IP addressing, static routing, VLANs, and inter-VLAN routing.
    - This lab reinforces foundational network configuration and troubleshooting skills at a manageable difficulty level.

## Questions to Answer:

1. **What is the purpose of static routing in this network setup?**
    - In a topology this small it makes just as much sense to create static routes as it does to configure a routing protocol.
    - This size topology is easy enough to manually manage and so it doesn't hurt to get some practice. 

2. **How do you assign a port on a switch to a specific VLAN?**
    - In Interface configuration mode:
        `switchport mode access`
        `switchport access vlan <vlan_id>`

3. **What happens if the `ip default-gateway` command is omitted on the switches?**
    - The switches will not be able to be managed remotely via telnet or ssh.

4. **Why is inter-VLAN routing necessary in this scenario?**
    - Each LAN is in it's own subnet and each subnet is in its own VLAN.
    - In order for each VLAN to communicate with the other, the VLANs must have their packets routed to each other, via a router or L3 switch. 

5. **How would you verify that static routes are correctly configured on the router?**
    - In enable mode:
        `show ip route`
    - Check the output against the topology and the network plan
    - Check connectivity with ping and, possibly, traceroute.
