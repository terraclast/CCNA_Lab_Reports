# CCNA Lab Reports

## Overview
Welcome to my CCNA Lab Reports repository. This repository contains my lab documentation for the labs I complete given by ChatGPT. Each lab is designed to enhance my, and hopefully your, understanding of networking concepts through practical exercises.
All labs were executed using PacketTracer. The format of the documentation will evolve as I develop that skill as well.  

Earlier labs will be basic text files while newer labs, starting 12/11/24, will use markdown format. 

## Repository Structure
The labs are organized into directories based on their topics:

- **[VLAN Labs](labs/VLANs/)**
- **[Routing Labs](labs/Routing/)**
- **[Subnetting Labs](labs/Subnetting/)**
- Additional topics will be added as they are completed.

Each lab contains:
- A **Markdown file** documenting the lab steps.
- A **questions section** to test understanding.
- Supporting files, such as diagrams or configurations.

## Completed Labs
### VLANs
- [Lab 1: Inter-VLAN Routing](labs/VLANs/Lab1_InterVLAN_Routing.md)

### Routing
- [Lab 1: Static and Dynamic Routing](labs/Routing/Lab1_Static_Routing.md)

### Subnetting
- [Lab 1: Subnetting Practice](labs/Subnetting/Lab1_Subnetting_Practice.md)

More labs will be added as they are completed.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/CCNA_Lab_Reports.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the desired lab directory to view the Markdown file.
3. Follow the steps and replicate the labs using your preferred tools (e.g., Packet Tracer, GNS3).
